# Platform Coverage And Boundaries

The assistant retrieves public material. A configured route is not equivalent
to a guaranteed search result, and no route bypasses platform access controls.

## Disabled Or Conditional Routes

| Platform | Status | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Douyin | Disabled RSSHub subscription slot | Needs a public account identifier and route validation; anti-crawling may still block it. |
| Kuaishou | Disabled RSSHub subscription slot | Same constraints as Douyin. |
| Private accounts, comments, recommendation feeds | Unsupported | Require login state, private APIs, or non-repeatable ranking. |

## Source Quality Rules

Before a result can become report evidence, the briefing service checks:

- It has a valid original `http` or `https` URL.
- It is not a known generic reference, search-result wrapper, login page, or
  malformed HTML/JSON page dump.
- A `site:` query result is actually inside the requested platform domain.
- It has enough topic or technical signal overlap to be relevant.
- CAD queries reject common medical uses of the acronym.
- Title and snippet are compacted before persistence and model synthesis.

The report keeps all retained original URLs. It does not imply that retained
sources are exhaustive, independently verified, or representative of all
platform discussions.

## RSSHub

The optional RSSHub setup is local-only by default. See
[domestic-rss.md](domestic-rss.md) for its catalog, health checks, and safety
constraints. Do not expose the local RSSHub port publicly without an access
control layer.
